# OMNIXIUS — Stack by direction

Priorities (in order): **security**, **speed**, **graphics**, **design**, **scalability**. Goal: **site, app, and project — best in the world**. Languages are chosen for that outcome.

**Language order (first to last):** Spark → Rust → Go → Swift → Kotlin → TypeScript/JS → Python → C++/C# (games) → Bash/Python/YAML (infra). Use each only where it delivers maximum for world-class result.

When adding or changing code, use only the stack below for each direction.

- **Server (logic, data, load):** Spark (analytics, recommendations), Rust (video, search, heavy compute), Go (API, microservices, chats).
- **Website (browser):** TypeScript/JavaScript, React or Vue for UI.
- **Mobile:** Swift (iPhone), Kotlin (Android).
- **Games (if any):** C++ (Unreal), C# (Unity).
- **AI / smart features:** Python (neural nets, recognition).
- **Infrastructure:** Bash/Python scripts, YAML for server config.

Existing code: `backend-go/` = Go API; `app/`, `js/` = web (migrate to TS + React/Vue when refactoring). Do not introduce new server logic in Node; use Go or Rust. See ARCHITECTURE.md §2 for full table and language order.
