# OMNIXIUS — Stack by direction

When adding or changing code, use only the stack below for each direction.

- **Server (logic, data, load):** Go (API, microservices, chats), Rust (video, search, heavy compute), Spark/Scala/Java (analytics, recommendations).
- **Website (browser):** TypeScript/JavaScript, React or Vue for UI.
- **Mobile:** Swift (iPhone), Kotlin (Android).
- **Games (if any):** C++ (Unreal), C# (Unity).
- **AI / smart features:** Python (neural nets, recognition).
- **Infrastructure:** Bash/Python scripts, YAML for server config.

Existing code: `backend-go/` = Go API; `app/`, `js/` = web (migrate to TS + React/Vue when refactoring). Do not introduce new server logic in Node; use Go or Rust. See ARCHITECTURE.md §2 for full table.
