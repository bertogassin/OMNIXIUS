# OMNIXIUS — Ecosystem map

One ecosystem: **what’s live now** (Mail, Marketplace, Shop, Profile) and **the full vision** (Connect, Trade & Finance, Repositorium, Blockchain, and more). Single account, one product.

---

## 1. What’s live now

| Direction | What it is |
|-----------|------------|
| **Mail** | Internal mail: conversations and messages between users. |
| **Marketplace** | Listings: browse, search, filters, categories. |
| **Shop** | Buy and sell: orders, “Contact seller” (opens Mail), order status. |
| **Profile** | Account, avatar, my orders (buyer/seller). |

Same app, same API (backend-go). More directions are added over time.

---

## 2. Full ecosystem (Connect, Trade, Repositorium, Blockchain, and more)

The “4” are part of the bigger picture; new directions keep being added.

| Platform / area | Role |
|-----------------|------|
| **OMNIXIUS CONNECT** | Social, experts, marketplace, chat, video. People and services. |
| **OMNIXIUS TRADE & FINANCE** | Exchange, wallets, copy trading, investments. Money and assets. |
| **OMNIXIUS REPOSITORIUM** | Decentralized storage and compute. Data and infrastructure. |
| **OMNIXIUS BLOCKCHAIN (IXI)** | Base layer: consensus, ZKP, tokenomics, buyback fund. Trust and economy. |
| **… and more** | Education, media, startups, your other projects — one account. |

---

## 3. How new directions connect

Additional projects and verticals plug into the same ecosystem so everything stays **one product**, not separate apps.

- **Where they attach**
  - **Connect** — anything social, expert, learning, media, community, support.
  - **Trade & Finance** — anything with payments, investments, rewards, subscriptions.
  - **Repositorium** — anything with files, storage, compute, backups, CDN.
  - **Blockchain (IXI)** — anything with tokens, governance, startups, loyalty, staking.

- **Cross-platform directions** (span 2+ platforms)
  - **Education / Learning** — courses and experts (Connect) + payments and rewards (Trade) + storage for materials (Repositorium).
  - **Startups / Launchpad** — fundraising and tokens (Blockchain + Trade) + community and experts (Connect).
  - **Media / Content** — creators and subscriptions (Connect) + payments (Trade) + storage and delivery (Repositorium).
  - **Rewards / Loyalty** — activity and referrals (Connect) + payouts and IXI (Trade + Blockchain) + optional storage rewards (Repositorium).

- **Single account**
  - One login for: Connect, Trade, Repositorium, Blockchain and all “other directions” built on top. No separate accounts per project.

- **Shared stack**
  - Same tech policy (SPARK, RUST, C++, SWIFT, GO), same security (PQC, Argon2id), same docs (ARCHITECTURE, ROADMAP). New directions use the same API and auth.

## 4. Adding a new direction

1. Decide which core platform(s) it belongs to (Connect / Trade / Repositorium / Blockchain).
2. Reuse: auth, users, wallets, storage, or blockchain from existing services.
3. Document it here under “Other directions” with 1–2 lines and which platforms it uses.
4. Link it from the site (Ecosystem page or Architecture) so the map stays clear.

---

## 5. Other directions (to expand)

*Add your other projects below; keep one line each and the platform(s) they use.*

| Direction | Platforms | Note |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| Mail (live) | Connect | Conversations, messages. |
| Marketplace & Shop (live) | Connect | Listings, orders, contact seller. |
| Learning / Courses | Connect, Trade, Repositorium | Experts, payments, storage. |
| Startups / IXI launchpad | Blockchain, Trade, Connect | Tokens, fundraising, community. |
| *… add more* | *…* | *…* |
